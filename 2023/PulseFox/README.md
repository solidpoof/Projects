# ðŸš¨ Scam Alert ðŸš¨

SolidProof had audited PulseFox, but alarming changes were made by the team to the audited contract. In line 284, "sender" was deceitfully changed to "owner," resulting in all sells transferring to the owner instead of the sender. The contract active on their website is a different address then stated in the audit report, making it NOT audited by SolidProof. The current contract poses a serious risk.

The original audit report, which is now no longer valid due to the changes made by the team, can be found here:

As security providers, we strongly advise all investors to steer clear of this project. Your safety matters. 

UPDATE: The PulseFox team is actively banning SolidProof employees from their community chats.

We believe this is enough suspecious activity to convince investors to stay far. SolidProof is further investigating this incident.
