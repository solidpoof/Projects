# KYC was revoked

We revoked the KYC on July, 29th 2023 because the "Mooky" project had previously been the victim of an attack that could not be fully clarified until now. The investigation has already been handed over to the state authorities and we are assisting in the process. 
The project team published an statement here:

We will not support any further launches of this team until the full facts have been clarified.
