//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// PREMISE: The FUEL-20 Token Contract serves as the core component to the reward framework for FuelFoundry applications on EVM compliant chains.
// Functions and feature-sets, some of which may be fine-tuned over time, leverage the multi-signature process `ExecutiveSession`,
// inspired by Roberts Rules of Order.
//
// Governance (2/3s req.): Custodial, Guardian, Executor are designated roles within the FuelFoundry Ecosystem.
// - While Custodial and Guardian serve unique roles in other FF contracts (i.e. FUEL-721), they operate equal roles for FUEL-20 governance
// - Majority, a 2/3rd multi-sig majority execution to enter Executive Session is required for updating low-level values
// - During Executive Session, Executor may:
//   - Update global setting variables
//   - Update staking reward percentages and blockrewards
//   - Add/Remove Mint Controllers
//   - Enable/Disable Shield Settings
// - During ExecutiveSession, Custodial and Guardian may:
//   - Enable/Disable Mint Controllers
// - All roles, excluding Oracle, at any time may:
//   - Propose and elect new role handlers
//   - Close Executive Session
//
// Operations(L1): Custodial, Guardian, Executor - Executives of the fabric.
// Operations(L2): Oracle - Readonly to fabric variables, may issue claims on behalf of stakers, utilize tools, may update limited config data.
// Minting:        mintControllers - Call ctrlMint function allowing for the minting of new tokens upto the maxSupply, and updateStakerRewardPerBlock to update validator returns for subchain operators.
// Initial Distro: As outlined in roadmap, escrow is sent to sender wallet upon construction.
//
// Fabric Roles (G1):
// - Custodial:    Open/Close ExecutiveSession, query es-code, propose new role handlers, enable/disable mint controllers.
// - Guardian:     Open/Close ExecutiveSession, query es-code, propose new role handlers, enable/disable mint controllers.
// - Executor:     Open/Close ExecutiveSession, add/delete mint controllers, update fabric variables, enable/disable shield settings.
//
// Fabric Roles (G2):
// - Oracle:       Read-only access to gov settings, may perform claim operation on behalf of fuel20 stakers (auto-claim).
//
// FuelSig Multi-Signature Execution:
// - Executive Session initialization requires two (2) of three (3) L1 gov wallets to enter es-code to init executive session.
// - Custodial and Guardian wallets operate as board members and are the only roles which may retrieve the executive session code.
// - Executor must be provided commit code from the guardian or custodial wallet to apply setting updates.
// - Executor commits said proposals as enacted during executive session.
// - Should Executor, or any gov actor, implement improper actions, the other two gov members may vote out the improper actor.
//
