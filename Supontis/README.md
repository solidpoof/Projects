# Blockchain Security by SolidProof

 We are specialized in auditing smart contracts and can find vulnerabilities in your blockchain project using manual and automated tests. With our informative report you give your community a good sense of security.

In an increasingly global economy, financial institutions are more vulnerable to illicit criminal activities. Know Your Customer (KYC) standards are designed to protect financial institutions against fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing.
