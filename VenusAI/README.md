The KYC for VenusAI was revoked on Monday, 13 March 2023 due to overtake by Cashverse ecosystem.

# Here is the official announcement of the project: 
Now after 3 weeks with ups and downs we are at a point to make decisions to be able to guarantee the continued existence of this really great product.

I would like to announce that from this moment VenusAI will be completely taken over by the Cashverse ecosystem. (TG: @cashverseportal) Headed by @therealhydra, Cashverse is a team that has been successfully integrated into the market since October 2021.

Since The Cashverse System does not want a 4th token, they offer every VenusAI holder a migration to their token Fortunecash. Every person who sends their token to the following address by Sunday, March 12, 2023 will receive a 1:1 airdrop of the dollar value worth on 12th March of their VenusAI token. If someone does not want this, they are free to sell their VenusAI tokens. Liquidity will stay here forever and trading will be kept open forever.

ℹ️ With this takeover, the bot and the web version will be rebranded with less porn on the outside. Since we realized how difficult it is to market porn to the outside world. But be sure, NSFW Content will not get blocked. 

In short:
You send your VenusAI Token to the mentioned wallet address -> you will get 1:1 $ worth (from 12th march) in FortuneCash  (CA:  0xf9f6f85e4b2296e93cc25c949d7f0364654485cc)

Hydra and his team will of course receive support from me at any time if it is needed. Even if Hydra is an absolute beast in coding.
With that said i wish everyone good Luck with this beauty of product and continous development. 
If there is anything my DM's or @therealHydra DM's are always open to make sure the migration happens without any problems.
